# Credit Score Analysis Model
This repository contains a simple Python script that demonstrates the creation of a basic credit score analysis model using synthetic data and the XGBoost classifier. This README.md file provides an overview of the code and how to run it.

# Requirements
Before running the code, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn
XGBoost

# You can install these libraries using pip:
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost

# Usage
#Clone this repository to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/RSM009/Finsearch_Credit_Score/

# Navigate to the project directory:
    cd <repository-directory>
    
# Run the credit_score_analysis.py script:
    python credit_score_analysis.py


# Code Overview
#The credit_score_analysis.py script follows these main steps:

#Data Generation: It generates synthetic data using scikit-learn's make_classification function, creating a dataset with 1000 samples and 10 features.

#Data Preprocessing: The script splits the data into training and testing sets, standardizes the numerical features using scikit-learn's StandardScaler, and prepares the data for model training.

#Model Training: It uses the XGBoost classifier from the xgboost library to train a credit score prediction model on the preprocessed data.

#Model Evaluation: The script makes predictions on the test set and evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and a classification report.

#Model Saving: It saves the trained model as 'credit_score_model.pkl' using scikit-learn's joblib.

# Output
After running the script, you will see the following output in the terminal:

Accuracy: The accuracy score of the model on the test data.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix showing the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative values.
Classification Report: Detailed statistics on precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
The trained model is also saved as 'credit_score_model.pkl' for future use.

Please note that this is a simplified example for educational purposes. Real-world credit scoring models involve more complex data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regulatory compliance.
